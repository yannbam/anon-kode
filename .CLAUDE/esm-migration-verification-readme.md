# ESM Migration Verification Guide

## Overview

The TypeScript ESM migration for anon-kode has been completed with all TypeScript compilation errors fixed. Now it's time to verify that no runtime errors were introduced during the migration and ensure the application functions as expected.

## Current Status

- All TypeScript compilation errors have been fixed (originally over 170 errors)
- Project now builds successfully with native ESM imports
- We need to test for potential runtime errors before merging to main

## Testing Resources

This directory contains several resources to help with verification:

1. **[esm-migration-testing-plan.md](./esm-migration-testing-plan.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategy with specific features to test

2. **[quick-verification-tests.md](./quick-verification-tests.md)** - Focused manual tests for core functionality

3. **[esm-runtime-troubleshooting-guide.md](./esm-runtime-troubleshooting-guide.md)** - Solutions for common ESM runtime errors

4. **[esm-test-script.js](./esm-test-script.js)** - Automated script to detect potential ESM import issues

5. **[branch-comparison-helper.sh](./branch-comparison-helper.sh)** - Script with commands to compare branches and builds

## Testing Procedure

1. **Build & Initial Testing**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   node bin/kode.js --help
   ```

2. **Run the ESM test script**
   ```bash
   node .CLAUDE/esm-test-script.js
   ```

3. **Perform manual verification**
   - Follow the tests in [quick-verification-tests.md](./quick-verification-tests.md)
   - Document any issues encountered

4. **Troubleshoot issues**
   - Reference the [esm-runtime-troubleshooting-guide.md](./esm-runtime-troubleshooting-guide.md) for solutions
   - Make necessary corrections

5. **Test with verbose logging if needed**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development pnpm run dev --verbose --debug
   ```

## Branch Comparison

To compare functionality between the main branch and the ESM branch:

1. Use the comparison helper for reference commands:
   ```bash
   ./.CLAUDE/branch-comparison-helper.sh
   ```

2. Test the same functionality on both branches
3. Note any differences in behavior

## Common Issues to Watch For

- Missing file extensions in imports
- Dynamic import failures
- JSON import issues (syntax changes in ESM)
- `__dirname`/`__filename` usage (not available in ESM)
- Circular dependency problems

## Next Steps After Verification

1. Document any remaining issues or concerns
2. Create an action plan for addressing any found issues
3. Once verified, prepare for merging to main

## Completion Criteria

The ESM migration verification is complete when:
- All verification tests pass without errors
- No runtime JavaScript errors occur during normal operation
- All features function as they did in the pre-ESM version
