# ESM Migration Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy to verify that the ESM (ECMAScript Modules) migration hasn't introduced runtime errors or functional regressions.

## Testing Approach

### 1. Basic Functionality Testing

- **Basic Application Start**
  - [ ] Verify the application starts without errors
  - [ ] Test the CLI entry point (`bin/kode.js`)
  - [ ] Check initialization sequence completes

- **Command Processing**
  - [ ] Test basic slash commands (/help, /model, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify command output renders correctly
  - [ ] Test interactive commands that use dialog boxes

### 2. Core Feature Testing

- **Model Integration**
  - [ ] Test connection to different AI providers
  - [ ] Verify model selection and switching works
  - [ ] Test response streaming functions correctly

- **File Operations**
  - [ ] Test file reading functionality
  - [ ] Test file writing functionality
  - [ ] Test file editing with diffs
  - [ ] Verify glob/search patterns work correctly

- **Shell Command Execution**
  - [ ] Test basic shell commands
  - [ ] Verify output capturing works correctly
  - [ ] Test directory navigation (cd command)

- **Conversation & Context Management**
  - [ ] Test conversation history retrieval
  - [ ] Verify context retention between messages
  - [ ] Test conversation forking/resuming

### 3. ESM-Specific Testing

- **Dynamic Import Testing**
  - [ ] Test features that use dynamic imports
  - [ ] Verify proper error handling for import failures

- **Module Resolution**
  - [ ] Check for paths that might need `.js` extensions
  - [ ] Verify imports across module boundaries
  - [ ] Test circular dependency handling

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **Network Error Handling**
  - [ ] Test behavior when API requests fail
  - [ ] Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

- **Input Validation**
  - [ ] Test with invalid/malformed inputs
  - [ ] Verify proper validation errors are shown

- **Resource Cleanup**
  - [ ] Verify resources are properly released
  - [ ] Test application shutdown sequence

### 5. Platform Compatibility

- **Node.js Version Testing**
  - [ ] Test on Node.js 20 (minimum required version)
  - [ ] Test on latest Node.js version
  - [ ] Verify compatibility with different package managers (npm, pnpm)

- **Operating System Compatibility**
  - [ ] Test on Linux
  - [ ] Test on macOS (if available)
  - [ ] Test on Windows (if available)

## Testing Tools & Methods

1. **Manual Testing Approach**
   - Create a checklist from this plan
   - Document any errors with screenshots/logs
   - Note platform-specific issues

2. **Runtime Error Detection**
   - Use `--trace-warnings` flag to detect unhandled promises
   - Enable verbose logging with `NODE_ENV=development pnpm run dev --verbose --debug`
   - Monitor console for errors and warnings

3. **Comparison Testing**
   - Compare behavior with main branch (pre-ESM)
   - Note any differences in functionality

## Error Resolution Strategy

For each error discovered:

1. **Document the Issue**
   - Exact error message and stack trace
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Environment details (Node version, OS, etc.)

2. **Classify the Error**
   - Import/export related
   - Path resolution issues
   - Type incompatibilities at runtime
   - Library integration problems

3. **Fix and Verify**
   - Apply targeted fixes for each issue
   - Re-test the specific feature
   - Ensure no regressions in related functionality

## Completion Criteria

The ESM migration can be considered successful when:

- All test scenarios pass without errors
- No runtime JavaScript errors occur during normal operation
- No TypeScript compile errors occur
- Performance is comparable to the pre-ESM version
- All features function as they did in the pre-ESM version
