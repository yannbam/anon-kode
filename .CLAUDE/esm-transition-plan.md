# ESM Transition Plan

## Background
The codebase is in a transitional state regarding ECMAScript Modules (ESM):
- Package is set to ESM mode with `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Some files have been updated to use explicit `.js` extensions (especially logging-related files)
- Most files don't have explicit extensions in import paths

## Phase 1: Suppress Type Errors (Completed)
- ✅ Updated tsconfig.build.json to use bundler moduleResolution
- ✅ Created build-temp.js script to complete build even with type errors
- ✅ Verified successful build and output in dist directory

## Phase 2: Complete ESM Transition
- [ ] Update all import statements to include `.js` extensions for local files
- [ ] Ensure dynamic imports consistently use `.js` extensions
- [ ] Fix or suppress missing module errors (e.g., '../types/logs')
- [ ] Test the build process to ensure clean compilation

## Phase 3: Type Error Resolution
- [ ] Address React component prop type errors
- [ ] Fix missing TypeScript type declarations
- [ ] Update type definition inconsistencies
- [ ] Fix other type errors systematically
